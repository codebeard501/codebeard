## About Me
> He's just this guy, you know?

My name is Steve, and I'm a programmer. Wait, that sounds like an intro to some Anonymous group. Let me start over.

I'm Steve. I've been programming in some form or other since 1995. I current live in Tennessee and make my living as an analyst at one of the larger companies in the area.

My development career has been ... we'll say ecclectic. I start with Basic in the summer of 1995 when I spent a couple of week with my grandparents and decided it had to be more enjoyable than watching the OJ Simpson trial.

Later, in Highschool, I'd work in Pascal. Top down programming at its finest. I did make a wicked intro screen with a completely dynamic flame effect, though - that was pretty cool.

Fast forward a few years, and I studied C++ at the local community college. I was ... we'll go with _motivationally challenged_ at the time. I did well in my programming classes, but generally failed at everything else.

Fast forward a few more years, and I've finally got my priorities straight. I'm back at the local CC, because what major university would want to touch the hot mess I'd shown myself to be so far? I got an AS in CS and one in Mathematics, and was then accepted to Virginia Tech where I completed a BS in CS and just narrowly missed Cum Laude (curse you Senior-itis!). This broadend my programming toolkit to include Java (primarily), C, and a smattering of Python.

I've since taught myself C# (no great feat, it's extremely similar to Java), and have been toying with various projects there.

My new goal, however, is to run with web development as much as possible. This repository, under my psuedonym Code Beard, is where I will be doing most of my development and testing.

As someone who likes his languages OO and strongly typed, this is going to be ... interesting.
