      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <quote>He's just this guy, you know?</quote><br>
      <p>I've been programming in some form or another since 1995 when I taught myself Basic on my grandparent's computer because it 
      <em>had</em> to be more entertaining than watching the OJ Simpson trial.</p>
      <p>Most of my development education was in C++ to start, with a more comprehensive education in Java with a smatter of C and Python
      when I got my degree in CS. I had some exposure to web development over the years, but mostly from the view of back end dev and
      fixing / tweaking various PHP forum software implementations.</p>
      <p>Now? Now I'm jumping full force into full stack web development, and this is where it will happen. I have a few project ideas
      that will drive my learning, but my end goal is to become more comfortable with the much more fluid development space of the web.
      As I'm a guy who tends to like is languages OO and strongly typed, I can already tell it'll be ... interesting.</p>
